### ‚ú® Projects :

- [Virtual Piano](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/Virtual_piano) : Play piano from any plane surface using Mediapipe Hand tracking system.
- [Stellar Variability Investigation in VR](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/Pixel_NASA-Stellar-Variability-Investigation-in-VR) : NASA - TESS data investigation in VR for Exoplanet discover + Stellar Variability.
- [Image Retrival System](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/Image-Retrieval-System) : Developed an image retrieval system. Color Moments, LBP, and HOG are examples of implemented feature extraction methods. Then, using techniques like PCA, LDA, SVD, and K-means, reduce the dimensionality to the top K features. Decision Tree, SVM, and Personalised PageRank classifiers were used to classify the data.
- [BrainNet](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/BrainNet) : Android application to solve the issue of biometric liveness detection from an EEG dataset.
- [EMNIST Evaluation](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/EMNIST_evaluation_CSE598_Project) : Variants in the Extended MNIST dataset were subjected to in-depth analysis. I was able to achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models using a simple Conv2D CNN model and precise hyperparameter tuning.
- [Depression Detection using Sentiment Analysis of social media](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/SentimentAnalysis) : Formulated a machine learning model to analyse thousands of Twitter tweets, to predict people‚Äôs sentiment by the correlation between emotions and specific linguistic features.
- [Best Buy](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/Pixi_Best_Buy) : Visualise commercial product data in AR on product by scanning barcode.
- [Project Trash](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/Project-Trash) : Built a CNN model (Resnet101 variant) for garbage classification and volume estimation. Also accurately mapped and visualized data using heat maps. Citizens can provide an image dataset, later used by local municipalities.
- [ShopAR](https://github.com/Prakhar-Bhartiya/ShopAR) : Try apparels on your 3D model(using single picture) before buying online in Augmented Reality.
- [Finger Vein Authentication System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402594)\[Publication]
- ProHelm : Smart biker's helmet with XR (Extended Reality) System for visual assistance in navigation(HUD). Extended augmented reality-based display effects were achieved by reflecting a mini projector onto the translucent helmet visor at a certain angle. Results provide a hands-free and distraction less biking experience.
- AR Assist : Augmented reality training program for manufacturing products.
- MUnix : Mobile + UNIX = MUNIX is a featured phone interface build on a UNIX system using command and Perl scripting for implementing various features of the phone.
